These repository contains NEURON models. Most have been adapted from modelDB (see ref for further details on the model).

	- MRGaxon 
	
		- from McIntyre and Grill (2002)
		- multicompartimental model of an axon.
		- adapted to include extracellular stimulation.
  		- Includes some of the work for my master thesis.

	- Traub2003 
	
		- from Traub et al. (2003)
		- multicompartimental model of a Pyramidal neuron
  		- includes the modules to test paralel neuron on a cluster.
	
	- CommonInputs  
	
		- Class for common inputs.
		- Default is the Khaliq and Raman model (2002), a single compartiment model of a Purkinje cell.
	
	- DSB94	
	
		- detailed multicompartimental model of a Purkinje cell.
		- De Schutter and Bower (1994) model


To run the channel noise models you might need to compile neuron with support for libgsl, to do that use the following flags:
	export LIBS='-lgsl -lgslcblas'
	export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib

And compile neuron from source in the usual way.
